The Aragon Court is a dispute resolution protocol that runs on Ethereum. It's one of the core components of the [Aragon Network](https://aragon.org/network/).

#### üê≤ Project stage: research and development
The Aragon Court is still in research phase and aspects of the mechanism are still being designed and implemented. The current implementation is rapidly changing and being improved, [see issues](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court/issues).

#### üö® Security review status: pre-audit
The code in this repo is highly experimental and hasn't undergone a professional security review yet, therefore we cannot recommend using any of the code or deploying the Court at the moment.

#### üëã Get started contributing with a [good first issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-court/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. Everyone will be especially nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!

## How does it work

**Full description of the mechanism: [Aragon Forum - Aragon Court v1](TODO)**

The Aragon Court handles subjective disputes that cannot be solved by smart contracts. For this, it employs jurors that need to stake a token to the Court which allows them to get drafted to adjudicate disputes, that can earn them fees. The more tokens a juror has activated, the higher the chance to get drafted and earn more fees.

The Aragon Court attempts to find what the subjective truth is with a [Schelling game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)). Jurors are asked to vote on the ruling that they think their fellow jurors are more likely to vote on. To incentivize consensus, jurors that don't vote on the consensus ruling have some tokens slashed. Jurors that vote with the consensus ruling are rewarded with ruling fees and juror tokens from the jurors that voted for a minority ruling.

A design goal of the mechanism is to require very few jurors to adjudicate a dispute and produce a ruling. A small number of jurors is adjudicated by default to a dispute, and their ruling can be appealed in multiple rounds of appeals.

Even though the Aragon Court could theoretically resolve any type of binary dispute, in its first deployments it will be used to arbitrate **Proposal Agreements.** These agreements require entities creating a proposal in an organization to agree to its specific rules around proposal creation, putting some collateral at stake that could be lost if the Court finds the proposal invalid.

This first version of the Aragon Court has been heavily inspired by [Kleros protocol](https://github.com/kleros/kleros).
